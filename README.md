# Car Crash Data Analysis (2003-2015) - Monroe County, NY

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing car crash data in Monroe County, New York, from 2003 to 2015. The primary objective was to understand how factors like time of day, day of the week, and month impact the frequency and severity of car accidents. The project also served as a platform to enhance data science skills, particularly in data visualization using Plotly.

## Key Questions Addressed
- How do time of day, day of the week, and month influence the frequency of car accidents?
- Are there discernible trends in the severity of injuries over time?

## Methodology
- **Data Exploration**: Examined the structure and contents of the car crash dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilized Plotly to create a series of interactive visualizations.
- **Data Analysis**: Interpreted the plots to derive insights about accident trends and patterns.

## Visualizations
1. **Day of the Week Analysis**: Grouped bar chart and polar plots showing accident frequencies by day.
2. **Time of Day Analysis**: Polar plots illustrating accident occurrences at different times.
3. **Month-wise Accident Trends**: Stacked bar charts displaying the monthly distribution of accidents.
4. **Accident Severity Over Time**: Line plots depicting trends in different types of injuries.

## Key Findings
- A significant proportion of accidents resulted in no injuries.
- Mondays in 2003 recorded the highest number of accidents.
- The period from 12 PM to 8 PM saw the highest frequency of accidents.
- Contrary to expectations, advancements in technology did not lead to a consistent decrease in accident rates over the years.

## Tools and Technologies
